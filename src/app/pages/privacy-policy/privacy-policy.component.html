          <h3><em>Personal Data We Collect Automatically</em></h3>



          <p>As you navigate our website, we may also collect information through the use of commonly used information-gathering tools, such as web beacons, standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your IP address, and the actions you take on our website.&nbsp; We may receive reports based on your use of our website and/or products and services from third party service providers as de-identified information or as aggregate data (as defined below). </p>



          <h3><em>Personal Data We Collect From Third-Parties</em></h3>



          <p>We may obtain personal data about you from third-party products or from third party sponsored activities or events in which you are a participant. For example, we may obtain geolocation and biometric data from third-party products, such as bicycle computers, triathlon watches, heart rate monitors or similar devices.&nbsp; We may also obtain geolocation and biometric data from third-party services, such as third-party genetic screening applications and third-party workout mapping platforms.&nbsp; We may obtain genetic data from third-party service providers with whom you have subscribed to for services and elected to share with us.&nbsp; Personal data will only be obtained by us from such third-party providers if and to the extent you elect to have such personal data transmitted to us. </p>

          cookies” (a piece of information stored on your computer temporarily and
          deleted from the user’s device when the browser is closed) and “persistent
          cookies” (which stay on your device until you delete them).&nbsp; Session cookies help us confirm your identity
          and are required in order to log into your account, whereas persistent cookies
          assist you in using our website or services (such as by not having to re-enter
          your username and password each time you use our services) or aid in website
          navigation.</p>



          <p>We also use performance cookies provided by

          advantage of all of the features and services on the website.</p>



          <p>Some web browsers have a “do not track”
          feature.&nbsp;This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not
          want to have your online activity tracked.&nbsp;These features are not yet
          uniform across browsers.&nbsp;Our sites are not currently set up to respond to
          those signals.</p>



          <h2>4. Uses of Personal Data</h2>



          <h3><em>Uses
          of Personal Data</em></h3>

          provide you with notices.&nbsp; Following are
          examples of how we use your personal data and, if you are a resident of the
          European Union (the “EU”), the legal basis for such use:</p>



          <ul><li>We may process
          the personal data you provide to us when you fill in forms on our website to
          respond to your request and to contact you about that request. Our legal basis
          for processing this personal data is our legitimate interest in communicating

          the performance of our contract to provide products and services to you;
          provided, that for any biometric, genetic or other sensitive personal data, the
          basis for such processing is consent.&nbsp;
          You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account;
          however, the withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of
          processing based on consent before its withdrawal. </li></ul>



          <ul><li>We may process
          your personal data for purposes of allowing you to share such personal data
          with others (e.g., coaches or other users) through our products and
          services.&nbsp; Our legal basis for processing
          this personal data is your consent.&nbsp; You
          may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account; however, the
          withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based

          such processing is consent.&nbsp; You may
          withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account; however, the
          withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based
          on consent before its withdrawal. </li></ul>



          <ul><li>For data and
          information that we collect through tracking technologies about your
          interaction with our website, products and services, we use this information

          <h3><em>Retention
          of Personal Data</em></h3>



          <p>Personal data is not kept by us for longer
          than is necessary for the specific purpose identified in this privacy policy
          unless we are required to retain your personal data for a longer period of time
          to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain
          your personal data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and
          enforce our legal agreements and policies.&nbsp;
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you create an account with us, we will
          retain your personal data for so long as you maintain such account and for a
          period of three (3) years thereafter. &nbsp;</p>



          <h3><em>Automated
          Decision-Making</em></h3>



          <p>We do not use any personal data provided by
          you for the purpose of any automated decision-making that produces legal
          effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.</p>



          <h2>5.  Sharing of Personal Data</h2>



          <h3><em>Personal Data</em></h3>



          <p>We may disclose personal data that we collect
          or you provide as described below.&nbsp; We do
          not share or sell your personal data with any third-parties for direct
          marketing purposes.</p>



          <ul><li>We disclose
          personal data to third-party vendors who help us operate the website and the
          services, including hosting and cloud computing providers.&nbsp; These third-parties may be based in locations
          outside the “EU”. These third-parties are contractually obligated to maintain
          the confidentiality of your personal data consistent with the terms of this privacy
          policy and to comply with the applicable data protection laws.</li></ul>



          <ul><li>We may
          disclose your personal data if we believe in good faith that such action is
          necessary in order to comply with (i) a legal obligation, (ii) protect and
          defend the rights of TriDot, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
          personal safety of our users or customers, or (iv) protect against legal
          liability.</li></ul>



          <ul><li>If you
          purchase our products or services, your payment information may be provided to
          a third-party payment processor, and such processor’s use of such payment
          information would be governed by such processor’s own privacy and other
          policies. </li></ul>



          <ul><li>With your
          consent, we may provide your personal data to third-parties for purposes of
          enabling such third-parties to use such personal data for purposes of your
          relationship with such third-parties.&nbsp;
          Any use of your personal data by such third-parties will be subject to
          the terms and policies implemented by such parties, and TriDot shall have no
          responsibility for any improper use or disclosure of your personal data by such
          third-parties.&nbsp; TriDot will obtain your
          express consent prior to any such disclosure, and if you do not wish for your
          personal data to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to permit TriDot
          to disclose it. </li></ul>



          <ul><li>We may, from
          time to time, partner with other companies to jointly offer products or
          services. In such cases, you will be asked to specifically opt in to share your
          personal data with our business partners if you choose to purchase or
          specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.&nbsp; If you do not wish for your information to be
          shared in this manner, you may choose not to purchase or express interest in a
          jointly offered product or service.</li></ul>



          <ul><li>We may
          transfer your information to an entity or individual that (i) acquires, buys,
          or merges with us, or our affiliated business units or (ii) acquires or
          otherwise takes possession of all or any part of our business assets, including
          in connection with a liquidation or dissolution. </li></ul>



          <h3><em>Aggregated Data</em></h3>



          <p>We
          may share with third-parties “aggregate data,” which is information that has
          been removed of any personal data and is combined with information of others so
          that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual. This information
          does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular
          individual’s data.&nbsp; We may share
          aggregate data with our users as well as third-parties as we deem appropriate. </p>



          <h2>6.  Data Security</h2>



          <p>We
          take the protection of your data seriously and use reasonable measures to
          safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of any data we collect. Despite
          using reasonable protections to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the
          security of the information you share with us.&nbsp;
          We use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow
          for the encryption of personal data and credit card numbers and employ network
          segmentation strategies to prevent disclosure to bad actors. We also engage
          providers that are industry leaders in online security to strengthen the
          security of our products and services. &nbsp;</p>



          <p>To
          maximize the effectiveness of our security measures, you should use a
          security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other
          personal data to us. Please note that if you do not use a SSL-capable browser,
          you are at risk for having data intercepted.&nbsp;
          We also recommend using a unique password in connection with your
          account and updating that password frequently.</p>



          <p>While
          we continue to work hard to protect your personal data, no data transmission
          over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and we cannot guarantee
          the security of any personal data you provide to us. </p>



          <h2>7.  Your Rights</h2>



          <p>We strive to provide you with choices
          regarding the personal data you provide to us, and we understand that you may
          have the right to access, correct, delete, object to and restrict our use of
          your personal data.&nbsp; In particular, if
          you are a resident of the EU, you have the following rights with respect to
          your personal data:</p>



          <ul><li><strong>Access. </strong>You
          can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal data, to give you
          a copy of that data, and to provide you with other information about your
          personal data (to the extent that such information has not already been
          provided to you in this privacy policy).</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Rectification.</strong> You can ask us to rectify inaccurate information. We may
          seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Erasure.</strong>
          You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only (i) when it is no longer
          needed for the purposes for which it was collected, (ii) when you have
          withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent), (iii)
          following a successful right to object, (iv) when it has been processed unlawfully,
          or (v) to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject. We are not
          required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the
          processing of your personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal
          obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
          There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply
          with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances
          in which we would deny that request.</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Restriction. </strong>In certain contexts, you can ask us to restrict (i.e., keep
          but not use) your personal data.&nbsp; We can
          continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction (i)
          where we have your consent; (ii) to establish, exercise, and defend legal claims;
          or (iii) to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Objection. </strong>You can object to any processing of your personal data
          which has our ‘legitimate interests’ as its legal basis if you believe your
          fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you
          have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling
          legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. In addition, you
          can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing
          purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such
          direct marketing without providing any reason. We will then cease the
          processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Portability. </strong>You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a
          structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it
          ‘ported’ directly to another data controller, but only where our processing is
          based on your consent and the processing is carried out by automated means.</li></ul>



          <ul><li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent.</strong> You can withdraw your consent in respect of any processing
          of personal data which is based upon a consent which you have previously
          provided.</li></ul>



          <p>Requests for any of the foregoing should be
          submitted via email to: privacy@tridot.com.&nbsp;
          Please allow a reasonable time to process any such request.</p>



          <h2>8.&nbsp; International Transfers</h2>



          <p>If we transfer any
          personal data from the UK, Switzerland or the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to
          a third country or territory outside the UK, Switzerland or the EEA that has
          not received a binding adequacy decision by the European Commission or a competent
          national data protection authority, such transfer will be subject to
          appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
